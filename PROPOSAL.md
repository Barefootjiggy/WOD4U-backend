WOD4U

Project Description

My app is called WOD4U. It's a fitness app for users who want to have a workout displayed for them and have the ability to CRUD. Users will only be able to update, delete and create their own workouts and it will all be added to the preset workout database where all users will have the ability to read the workouts as well as favorite workouts.
